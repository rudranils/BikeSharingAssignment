# Bike Sharing Assignment 
> Build a Multiple Linear Regression model to find the variables affecting significantly on bike renting.


## Problem Statement:
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic 
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
- So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- Develop a model to find the variables which are significantly affecting the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- It will be used by the management to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors like: Count, Humidity, temperature, season etc
